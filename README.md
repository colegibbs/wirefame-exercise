### Reflections and Comments 08b

Today I learned about the flex display in css. I thought it was much easier to style using the flex property. I also learned it is best to style from left to right and top to bottom which was also very helpful in styling my web page. I also learned about wire-framing and how useful they are. It's much easier to style with css when you already know what you are trying to do. I often find myself using css in a throw it at the wall and see what sticks fashion. Using wire-frames makes it much clearer what needs to be done for the web site to look good. I also learned how to use the pseudo class :hover with the transition attribute to make a hover transition look really good.
